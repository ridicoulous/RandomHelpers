# RandomHelpers
Simple helper library to get exponential and normal distributed number(s) and shuffling of list
# Usage:
You need to instatiate Random class and use library as extension
.GetNextExponentialDistrubutedNumber
.GetNextNormalDitributedNumber
.GetNormalDistributedList
.GetExponentialDistributedList

Also here is thread safe implementation of list shuffling
.Shuffle
